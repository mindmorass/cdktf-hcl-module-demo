# Examples Directory

This directory contains examples for using the CDKTF HTML File Module and demonstrates the complete CDKTF â†’ HCL workflow.

## Available Files

### Core Examples

- **use-generated-module-terraform.tf** - Shows how traditional Terraform can use the generated HCL module locally
- **use-github-module.tf** - Shows how to use the module from GitHub releases

### Generated Output

The examples create HTML files that are generated during the demo:

- **output/** - Contains the actual HTML files created by the demo (generated by main demo script)

### Terraform State Files

- **.terraform/** - Terraform working directory (generated during demo)
- **terraform.tfstate** - State from running traditional Terraform (generated during demo)
- **.terraform.lock.hcl** - Provider version locks (generated during demo)

## Running the Examples

### Using the Local Generated Module

The examples are automatically created and run by the main demo script:

```bash
# From the project root
./demo-workflow.sh
```

This will:

1. Generate the CDKTF examples
2. Create the traditional Terraform examples
3. Run both workflows
4. Create HTML files in the output directory

### Using the GitHub Module

To use the module from GitHub releases:

```bash
# Navigate to examples directory
cd examples

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply

# This will download the module from GitHub and create the HTML files
```

## What Gets Demonstrated

1. **CDKTF Direct Usage**: Creates HTML files directly from TypeScript
2. **HCL Module Generation**: Extracts reusable HCL modules from CDKTF
3. **Traditional Terraform**: Uses the generated modules with standard terraform commands
4. **CDKTF Import**: Shows how CDKTF can import and use the generated HCL modules

## Viewing Results

After running the demo, open the generated HTML files:

```bash
# View the generated files
open output/cdktf-generated.html
open output/terraform-generated.html
open output/team-demo.html
```

Each file will clearly show which tool created it and demonstrate the complete workflow.
