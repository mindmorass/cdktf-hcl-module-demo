echo "Complete Workflow:"
echo "  CDKTF (TypeScript) → Native HCL (as module) → Traditional Terraform"

echo "Key Advantages:"
echo "  - CDKTF natively outputs HCL - no conversion scripts needed"
echo "  - Escape hatches allow fine-grained control over generated HCL structure"
echo "  - Simple variable structure makes modules easy to use"
echo ""
echo "Benefits for your team:"
echo "  • Write infrastructure modules in TypeScript with full type safety"
echo "  • Generate HCL modules that work with existing Terraform workflows"
echo "  • Teams can use familiar tools (terraform CLI) with CDKTF-generated modules"
echo "  • Gradual adoption - mix CDKTF and traditional Terraform as needed"
